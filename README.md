# ExamSchedulingInsights
Welcome to the Exam Scheduling Insights repository! This project provides an in-depth analysis of candidate scheduling and exam-taking behavior. Through data visualization and exploration, we uncover valuable insights to understand the patterns and trends in exam scheduling.

Overview:-

This project focuses on three key questions:

  1.Hour with the highest frequency of candidates scheduled: Identify the hour when most candidates are scheduled for exams.

  2.Day vs. Night Exam Taking: Explore the distribution of candidates taking exams during day and night hours.

  3.Age Group Analysis: Understand the distribution of candidates across different age groups.
